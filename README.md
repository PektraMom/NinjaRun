First time creating game to understand how to use Unity and C#

This is a game I created around the first week of october. I've stopped the project on October 22nd and want to create a new 2D game with what I have learned so far. This is also the first time I've used Unity and learn how to code 2D game using C#. After a couple months of research. This is what I could come up with, a platformer 2D game. 

// Sprites
In the first room of the game, trees, ground, rocks and bushes were created by a friend of mine as he was testing how to draw using LiteSprite.
The main character was also done by him.
For the rest of the sprites (trees, bushes, rocks, boxes, NPC, etc.) all were from Unity Asset Store.

// Level
I created the level by myself without help just to work my creativity and level design.

// What I have learned
- Movement (understanding Vector2, Vector3, Input.GetAxis/GetAxisRaw, GravityScale, Interpolate)
- Camera control/follow (still have a hard time to understand)
- Adding sprites
- Understanding GameObjects, tag, layer
- Animation (animator controller, parameters)
- Awake, Start, Update, FixedUpdate functions
- Colliders (BoxCollider2D, Polygon2D)
- How to implement functions (ie: Jump(), Attack(), isGrounded(), etc.)
- Time.deltaTime
- SerializeField
- LayerMask
- Transform 

// Challenges
I think I can find challenges every step of the way and I need to do some research on how things work and what code to use. So I verify on YouTube, Unity documentation, ChatGPT, etc.
